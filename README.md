# typeRush


> Under development!

**TypeRush** is an interactive typing game built with Python and PySide6. It helps not only to track typing *accuracy, words per minute (WPM)*, and other metrics, but also to raise awareness about **climate change**. It also provides feedback to users to help  improve their typing skills by integrating with *MySQL* for storing and fetching data.

## Aim 
The goal of TypeRush is to educate users about climate change and provide a fun and interactive typing test. Each session is loaded with climate facts, to encourage environmentally friendly actions.üå±üåç

## Features 
- Typing Accuracy Tracking- Calculates typing accuracy using the Levenshtein distance.
- WPM Calculation- Measures words per minute.
- Custom GUI- Vibrant PySide6 interface.
- Performance Summary- Shows results after each typing session.
- User Accounts- Register and log in with MySQL to track your progress.
