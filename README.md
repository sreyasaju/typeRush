**TypeRush** is an interactive typing game built with Python and PySide6 that can be used as either a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI) application. It helps not only to track typing *accuracy, words per minute (WPM)*, and other metrics, but also to raise awareness about **climate change**. It also provides feedback to users to help  improve their typing skills by integrating with *MySQL* for storing and fetching data.

## Aim 
The goal of TypeRush is to educate users about climate change and provide a fun and interactive typing test. Each session is loaded with climate facts, to encourage environmentally friendly actions.üå±üåç

## Features 
- Typing Accuracy Tracking- Calculates typing accuracy using the Levenshtein distance.
- WPM Calculation- Measures words per minute.
- Custom GUI- Vibrant PySide6 interface.
- Performance- Shows results after each typing session.
- User Accounts- Register and log in with MySQL to track your progress.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ installed
- MySQL Server installed and running

## Installation:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sreyasaju/typerush.git
cd typerush
```

Setup a Virtual Environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## Environment Setup

TypeRush requires a `.env` file in the project root to store database connection details. Create a file named `.env` and add the following variables:

```
DB_USER=your_database_username
DB_PASS=your_database_password
DB_NAME=typerush_db
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
```

Replace the values with your MySQL server credentials. This file is required for both GUI and CLI versions to connect to the database.

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** TypeRush supports both GUI and CLI versions. You can run the CLI version by adding the `--cli` flag when starting the script.

Run the script: 
```bash
# Run GUI version
python3 main.py

# Run CLI version
python3 main.py --cli
```
